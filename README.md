# PFRPG Malady Tracker
This extension handles automatic rolling of saving throws against poisons, diseases, and other types of maladies.

# Compatibility and Instructions
This extension has been tested with [FantasyGrounds Unity](https://www.fantasygrounds.com/home/FantasyGroundsUnity.php) 4.1.13 (2022-01-05).

If you're using this with Pathfinder, you should absolutely get the [Maladies Library](https://github.com/bmos/FG-PFRPG-Maladies-Library) module as well. This module contains over 600 pre-entered maladies.

You may also want to use my [Upgrade NPC Actions extension](https://github.com/bmos/FG-PFRPG-Upgrade-NPC-Actions) to have links added to NPC notes tabs so you don't have to search for the right malady in-game or during prep.

# Features
* Tracks diseases or poisons that are incurred.
* If poison, show buttons to increaes DC or duration (for subsequent doses/exposure)
* Manual button to roll against listed save DC and announce success/failure
* Automatic counting of rolled saves (automatic or manual), taking into account consecutive/nonconsecutive requirements.
* [Kelrugem's IFTAG](https://www.fantasygrounds.com/forums/showthread.php?50297-(New-IF-operator)-New-and-much-better-version-of-Save-versus-tags) support (diseasetracker, maladytracker, infestationtracker, etc -- IFTAG: diseasetracker; SAVE: 2)
* Automatic rolling of variable onset, duration, and frequency when the malady is added to the character.
* Notification message in the chat when a poison or disease that has multiple possible DCs is used (to remind the GM to set the DC).
